**Spotify SDK Integration**: This task utilizes the [Spotify Web API TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/spotify/spotify-web-api-ts-sdk).

## Important Note

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Just a quick heads-up about the project:

- The behavior may vary in certain scenarios.
- Most songs may not work due to the requirement of Spotify Premium for requesting song URIs.
- I've implemented song previews, but please note that not all songs have them.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification!
